title: Dark Knights - Hackers for Impact

It is an exciting time to be alive, especially here in India. Everything we know is getting disrupted - except, of course, for the higher technical education. 75% of all graduates in India are engineers, who after spending at least 60+ hours a week for 2 years to get into engineering, spend 4 years trying to run as far as possible from it. I know this really well because I was one such engineer.

After three boring years of Electrical Engineering at one of India's top colleges, I decided I was not cut out to become an engineer. I was better: I was designed to manage and lead people. But, one does not simply get an MBA without building a resume.

I consciously decided to apply for a "different" intership. This was summer of 2008 when Microfinance was really hot. The Microfinance Institution (MFI) was looking for any kind of technology recommendations and I was looking to learn as much about business and processes as possible. What started off as a not-so-pure motive, soon changed my life completely.

After my first field visit, I was bursting with ideas and questions: Why can't we be faster? Why can't we do it this way? Why can't we use more technology? My supervisor, a young pragmatic american, tried to explain the limitations and constraint: limited operating margins, costs of implementing technology, tech savvy and language limitations of field agents, failed technology pilots, but highlighted that he is keen on exploring options provided they have been demonstrated to work.

My inquisitiveness and naivety took me to other teams - Credit, Operations, Distributions, IT. I kept hearing the same message again and again "Technology never works at the BoP". The business would say IT never gets our requirements and the IT team would point out that every 3 months "they change their requirements - how does one build technology then?". This, I would realize over the next five years, is common to all social enterprises: Social Enterprises are constantly tweaking their processes based on products/services, geographies or more simply, experimenting and keeping what works. They avoid implementing technology until an investor pushes them or they reaching a breaking point. Due to their limited affordability, most technology vendors provide a scaled down product which barely seems to work with zero support. Users, would over time, improvize and enter data in ways to fool the system into supporting their unique products/services, not realizing that they are compounding the problem: increasing inefficiencies, making their data / reporting virtually unusable. There approach to solving the problem is to throw more people and increase the complexity of the process rather than investing in technology. 

By the end of my internship, I had devised a solution to deliver simple account information in the field (which would earlier take 15 days) using SMS (texting service). The customers loved it, the field force loved it, the senior management loved it. The MFI implemented this at scale. As an intern, I was over the moon, because I had built something that actually works in the field.

Five years later, we at Artoo, have developed a more holistic solution. We believe this can dramatically alter the social enterprise landscape. We can help enterprises reach out to a larger cusotmer base. We can help the enterprise offer innovative and customized products rather than providing a product for the largest common denominator. This has the potential to improve the relation between customers and field agents -- moving it from transactional to a consultative one. Isn't that going to be game changing?

Yet in our 3 years as a company, we have often been slighted by investors and network organizations who draw an imaginary line and call us "service providers". Service providers do not fit anyone's mandate: Their impact is derivative, they are "merely" optimizing the real organization. If we are so non-essential or we can easily be substituted, why haven't social enterprises scaled

I love competition and market driven approach, but there is no point in creating competing models in the same geogrphay to serve the same clients when there are so many places / people untapped. Keeping egos aside and founderistis, I would rather improve what already exits before creating a paraller system.







There is a strong interest in the terms "Social Enterprise" or "Impact". There are conferences and programs identifying, showcasing and building capacity for social entepreneuers and there conferences that explain the "market-driven approach to development".

There is a even bigger trend of "Enterpreneurship". Everyone wants to "start up"! There is some overlap
